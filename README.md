#### âœ¦â€‚About:
I do not claim ownership of any of these icons; all of them are created by the VUESAX team. Unfortunately, their WEB FONT package does not work so I went through all of them and created a full icons list cheat sheet, including removing duplicates and fixing a few spelling mistakes here and there.

<sub>**Prior to 2023,** these icons were not technically an "icon font"; they were invoking SVGs with jQuery, which took time to load. Now, they're available as an actual icon font!</sub>

The SVG version is now archived, but you can still use them at: [glenthemes.github.io/iconsax/svg-ver](https://glenthemes.github.io/iconsax/svg-ver)

#### âœ¦â€‚How to Use:
Paste this under `<head>`:
```html
<link href="https://iconsax.gitlab.io/i/icons.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

To use an icon, paste the following line where you want your icon to be:
```html
<i class="iconsax" icon-name="milk"></i>
```

Choose an icon from [the list](https://iconsax.gitlab.io/i/view), copy the name and paste it between the `""` of `icon-name=""`.  
(in this case, replace `milk`).

To edit the appearance of the icons (e.g. size and color), you can use standard CSS like you would style text:
```css
.iconsax {
    font-size: 18px;
    color: #86a3eb;
}
```
